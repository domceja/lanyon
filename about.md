<p class="message">
  My name is Dominique Ceja. I am a passionate, self-taught engineer. I graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a B.S. in Business Administration. My passion for technology and software resurfaced after suffering a brutal leg injury during a colligate game as a student-athlete for the university. 
  <br>
I enjoy challenges and learning new things as well as breaking them. 
<br>
Outside of software, I am a world traveler. I enjoy emerging myself within historic relics, culture, heritage and tradition's of a country's motherland. I hope to take my talents and work overseas to help aid in my rambunctious wanderlust.
